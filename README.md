# [R for Humans, Ensemble Modeling, and Deep learning (with Keras)](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRUG/events/247282214/)


## [Introduction](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Chicago-R-User-Group/2018-n2/blob/master/Introduction.html#1)

**Thursday, February 15:** Join us for a trio of interesting talks on writing good R code, ensemble modeling in sports analytics & hedge funds, and extending R to Keras. Hosted by **IBM**, a variety of food and beverage options will be generously provided, so bring your appetite! Doors open at **5:30** and presentations begin at **6**, each running about 20 minutes. There will be time for networking and general discussion afterwards.
